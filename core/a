A 1
wonderful 1
serenity 1
has 1
taken 1
possession 1
of 1
my 1
entire 1
soul, 1
like 1
these 1
sweet 1
mornings 1
of 1
spring 1
which 1
I 1
enjoy 1
with 1
my 1
whole 1
heart. 1
I 1
am 1
alone, 1
and 1
feel 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
existence 1
in 1
this 1
spot, 1
which 1
was 1
created 1
for 1
the 1
bliss 1
of 1
souls 1
like 1
mine. 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
happy, 1
my 1
dear 1
friend, 1
so 1
absorbed 1
in 1
the 1
exquisite 1
sense 1
of 1
mere 1
tranquil 1
existence, 1
that 1
I 1
neglect 1
my 1
talents. 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
incapable 1
of 1
drawing 1
a 1
single 1
stroke 1
at 1
the 1
present 1
moment; 1
and 1
yet 1
I 1
feel 1
that 1
I 1
never 1
was 1
a 1
greater 1
artist 1
than 1
now. 1
When, 1
while 1
the 1
lovely 1
valley 1
teems 1
with 1
vapour 1
around 1
me, 1
and 1
the 1
meridian 1
sun 1
strikes 1
the 1
upper 1
surface 1
of 1
the 1
impenetrable 1
foliage 1
of 1
my 1
trees, 1
and 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
stray 1
gleams 1
steal 1
into 1
the 1
inner 1
sanctuary, 1
I 1
throw 1
myself 1
down 1
among 1
the 1
tall 1
grass 1
by 1
the 1
trickling 1
stream; 1
and, 1
as 1
I 1
lie 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
earth, 1
a 1
thousand 1
unknown 1
plants 1
are 1
noticed 1
by 1
me: 1
when 1
I 1
hear 1
the 1
buzz 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
world 1
among 1
the 1
stalks, 1
and 1
grow 1
familiar 1
with 1
the 1
countless 1
indescribable 1
forms 1
of 1
the 1
insects 1
and 1
flies, 1
then 1
I 1
feel 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
Almighty, 1
who 1
formed 1
us 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
image, 1
and 1
the 1
breath 1
of 1
that 1
universal 1
love 1
which 1
bears 1
and 1
sustains 1
us, 1
as 1
it 1
floats 1
around 1
us 1
in 1
an 1
eternity 1
of 1
bliss; 1
and 1
then, 1
my 1
friend, 1
when 1
darkness 1
overspreads 1
my 1
eyes, 1
and 1
heaven 1
and 1
earth 1
seem 1
to 1
dwell 1
in 1
my 1
soul 1
and 1
absorb 1
its 1
power, 1
like 1
the 1
form 1
of 1
a 1
beloved 1
mistress, 1
then 1
I 1
often 1
think 1
with 1
longing, 1
Oh, 1
would 1
I 1
could 1
describe 1
these 1
conceptions, 1
could 1
impress 1
upon 1
paper 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
living 1
so 1
full 1
and 1
warm 1
within 1
me, 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
mirror 1
of 1
my 1
soul, 1
as 1
my 1
soul 1
is 1
the 1
mirror 1
of 1
the 1
infinite 1
God! 1
O 1
my 1
friend 1
-- 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
much 1
for 1
my 1
strength 1
-- 1
I 1
sink 1
under 1
the 1
weight 1
of 1
the 1
splendour 1
of 1
these 1
visions! 1
A 1
wonderful 1
serenity 1
has 1
taken 1
possession 1
of 1
my 1
entire 1
soul, 1
like 1
these 1
